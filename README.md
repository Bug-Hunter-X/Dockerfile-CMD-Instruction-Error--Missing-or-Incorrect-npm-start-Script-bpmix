# Dockerfile CMD Instruction Error: Missing or Incorrect npm start Script

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the `CMD` instruction attempts to run `npm start`, but the `package.json` file lacks a properly defined `start` script or contains an incorrect script.

## Problem

The provided Dockerfile uses `CMD ["npm", "start"]`. However, the `package.json` file either does not have a `start` script defined, or the script has errors causing it to fail.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `package.json` file includes a properly configured `start` script. This will allow `npm start` to execute correctly when the Docker container is started.

To fix this issue, you need to add or correct the `start` script within the `package.json` file under the "scripts" property. For example:

```json
{
  // ... other properties
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node your_app.js"
  }
}
```

Replace `your_app.js` with the actual entry point to your application.

## How to reproduce

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Build the Docker image using the provided `Dockerfile` (without the fix): `docker build -t faulty-image .`
3.  Attempt to run the container: `docker run faulty-image`. You should see an error related to the missing or incorrect `start` script.
4.  Now modify the `package.json` to include the fixed start script.
5.  Build and run the container again using the updated `Dockerfile`. This time it should start properly.
